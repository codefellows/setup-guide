## Cloud Service Providers - Netlify

As part of the 401 Curriculum and beyond, you'll be using various cloud service providers to deploy code. Here, we'll get a Netlify account created and install command line tools.

### Netlify

1. Create an account at [netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com)
   - Simply "Login with GitHub" and your account will be created and connected to GitHub
1. Install the CLI tools, by running this command in your terminal:
   - `npm install -g netlify-cli`
1. Confirm proper installation
   - `netlify --version`
   - You should see a version number, such as `netlify-cli/2.53.0 linux-x64 node-v12.18.0`
