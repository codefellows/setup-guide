# Verify Your Setup

> By the time youâ€™ve completed the guide, you should be able to run the following commands in your terminal and see the expected output.  Your versions may be slightly different than what is listed here due to recent updates.


Run the following set of commands:

```bash
http --version
postgres --version
psql --version
aws --version
```

You output should resemble the following, with your version numbers likely being different:

```bash
2.3.0
postgres (PostgreSQL) 12.10
psql (PostgreSQL) 12.10
aws-cli/2.1.10 Python/3.9.12 Darwin/21.5.0 source/x86_64 prompt/off
```
