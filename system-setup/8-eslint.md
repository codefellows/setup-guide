# Install ESLint and Folder Structure

## ESLint

**Run:**

`npm install -g eslint`

You should see a lot of feedback as it installs.

After it has completed,  **run:**

`eslint --version`

You should see something similar:

```bash
v6.7.2
```

- NOTE: There is a file named .eslintrc.json located in the class repository under configs. You wil copy this to the root of every project you create. This will be the same throughout 201-401.

## Folder Structure

Can you predict what these commands will do?

Type each of the following commands, one line at a time, to create a folder structure where you will store code on your computer:

```
cd ~
mkdir projects  
cd projects 
mkdir courses
cd courses
pwd
```

You should see an output similar to this:
`/home/your_user_name/projects/courses`

This is the place to clone repositories for labs
