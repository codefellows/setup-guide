# Install ESLint and Folder Structure

## ESLint

**Run:**

`npm install -g eslint`

You should see a lot of feedback as it installs.

After it has completed,  **run:**

`eslint --version`

You should see something similar:

```bash
v6.7.2
```

## Folder Structure
Run the following to create a structure where you will store code on your computer:

```
mkdir projects  # This Will create a folder called projects
cd projects  # This will Change Directory into the folder projects
mkdir codefellows 
cd codefellows
mkidr code102
cd code102
pwd
```

You should see an output like this:
`/home/your_user_name/projects/codefellows/code102`
