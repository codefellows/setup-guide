# Tree

Tree is a useful application that will allow you to look at a directory structure and files that are in a directory. Here is an example of what the output might look like after running the `tree` command:

```text
── courses
    ├── code102
    ├── code201
```

---

## Verify if Tree is already installed:

**_If this is your first time going through the setup guide on your current machine, skip this "Verify" section and move on to the "Install" section below_**

In your terminal, run:

- `tree --version`

> **IF** the output is this version or higher:
>
> ```bash
> tree v2.0.1 (c) 1996 - 2022 by Steve Baker, Thomas Moore, Francesc Rocher, Florian Sesser, Kyosuke Tokoro
> ```

## Install Tree

In your terminal, run:

- `brew install tree`

Once it completes, verify `tree` is installed by running the command:

- `tree --version`

Expected output should match this version, or higher:

>```bash
> tree v2.0.1 (c) 1996 - 2022 by Steve Baker, Thomas Moore, Francesc Rocher, Florian Sesser, Kyosuke Tokoro
>```
