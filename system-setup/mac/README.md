# Setting up your development environment

The next series of steps will walk you through getting your system setup with the proper applications and settings for macOS.

**OPEN YOUR TERMINAL** and let's get started!

Unless it's already in your Dock, the easiest way to open Terminal (which you'll have to do often) is by launching Spotlight Search with command-space, and typing "term". You should then be able to hit the enter key to launch it. Once it's running, drag the Dock icon to the left to keep it in your Dock, even after it's closed.
