# Backup Your Terminal/Shell Environment

## Backing up files

The first thing we'll do is backup your existing terminal setup.

There are a lot of ways that your terminal can be set up, determined by different configuration files.

We want to remove the old ways so we can start with a clean slate.

Make back ups of the files listed below. You may get a `No such file or directory` error for some of them. That's ok.

Run these commands:

- `mv ~/.bashrc .bashrc.bak`
- `mv ~/.bash_profile .bash_profile.bak`
- `mv ~/.profile .profile.bak`
- `mv ~/.zprofile .zprofile.bak`
- `mv ~/.zshrc .zshrc.bak`

Now, let's move on to getting our development applications installed.
