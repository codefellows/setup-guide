# Install Node.js

1. Open the [Node.js Download Page] in your browser.
1. Click the button to download for the **LTS** verison
1. Once the installer file downloads, open it and follow the on-screen instructions

## Verify that Node is properly installed

1. Open the GitBash Terminal
1. Run the following command: `node --version`

Expected output should be this version or higher:

> ```text
> v17.8.0
> ```

Verify that Node.js is working:

- Run the command:
  - `node`
- Type `5 + 5` and hit enter
  - The result should be `10`. If you get `11` your computer is broken. ;)
  - **Quit** node by pressing **control C** two times.

Did you get similar output for both?
