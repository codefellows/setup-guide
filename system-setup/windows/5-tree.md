# Tree

Tree is a useful application that will allow you to look at a directory structure and files that are in a directory. Here is an example of what the output might look like after running the `tree` command:

```text
── courses
    ├── code102
    ├── code201
```

---

## Verify if Tree is already installed:

**_If this is your first time going through the setup guide on your current machine, skip this "Verify" section and move on to the "Install" section below_**

In your terminal, run:

- `tree --version`

> **IF** the output is this version or higher:
>
> ```bash
> 0.6.7
> ```
>
> Continue to the [next page](./7-eslint.md)
>
> ---
> **else if** the output is not similar to the above:
>
> Continue with instructions on this page.

## Install Tree

In your terminal, run:

- `npm install -g tree-cli`

Once it completes, verify `tree` is installed by running the command:

- `tree --version`

Expected output should match this version, or higher:

> ```bash
> 0.6.7
> ```
