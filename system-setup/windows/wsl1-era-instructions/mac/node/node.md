# Install Node & NPM

**Run:**

`brew install node`

It will take a few minutes for the download and installation process to complete.

After it is complete **run:**

`node`

Type `5+5` and hit `enter`

The result should be `10`.  If you get `11` your computer is broken.

**Quit** node by pressing **control C** two times.
