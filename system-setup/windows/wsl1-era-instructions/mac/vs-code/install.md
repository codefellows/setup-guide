# Install VSCode

Download [VS Code for Mac](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) .zip file 

**NOTE:**  Do not open VS Code app yet.

1. Click the downloaded file at the bottom of Chrome (or double-click the .zip file in finder).

1. Drag the VS Code app into your Applications folder.

1. Open the app. (If you opened the app before it was in your Applications folder, you’ll need to reinstall.)

**NOTE:** After downloading, when you try to open VS Code , you may see a message:

 `Visual Studio Code can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software`

To fix this:

Go to Apple menu > System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General >  choose Open Anyway.

VS Code should now open.

**Next run:**

`code --version`

Should return something similar to:

```
1.43.1
fe22a9645b44368865c0ba92e2fb881ff1afce94
x64
```

**If yes** [continue to next step](open-vscode.md)

**Else**  return output is:

```
-bash: code: command not found
```

**or** anything weird **then** [click here](../../error/error.md)
