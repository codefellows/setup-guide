## Install VSCode Text Editor

Now it's time to install VSCode Text Editor, a sophisticated text editor for code, markup, and prose.

To get started, download [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), and after it is installed, launch the application.

[VSCode's documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs) is excellent. Review it now to familiarize yourself with the basics.

### Install shell commands

Open the **Command Palette** (⇧⌘P) and type 'shell command'

Then, click the **Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH** command.

Restart the terminal for the new $PATH value to take effect. 

### Associate VSCode with Git

Type the following command in your terminal:
`git config --global core.editor "code --wait"`

This command will not return any message unless there is an error.

### Install Node

To install Node, open your Terminal and copy and paste the following line, then hit Enter:

`sudo apt-get install nodejs`

Afterwards, you'll want to install Node Package Manager (NPM).

`sudo apt-get install npm`

If you run into issues trying to install Node from these steps, please contact your instructor.

It will take a few minutes for the download and installation process to complete.

### Install ESLint

Now that you have Node installed, you can install Node packages using its package manager, **NPM**. Open your terminal and enter:

`npm -g i eslint git-open`

You should see a lot of feedback as it installs.
