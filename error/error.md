# Handling Errors

Getting a weird error or something unexpected?

The first step is to double-check that you are following the instructions carefully. It's ok to try again.

If you continue to get an error, check your course syllabus for how to get in touch with your instructor or TAs.

Don't hesitate to reach out! Many issues can be resolved very quickly by those who have been through this process before. Most people need a little assistance with this process at one point or another.
