# Ops Setup

Your first step is ensure that your lab PC is connected to the internet, so you can update the operating system.

## OS Updates

Verify that your lab PC is connected to the internet via ethernet or Wi-Fi. Opening a web browser on your PC should let you access usual web pages.

Then, use the Ubuntu desktop GUI to update the OS to the latest version. This may take some time, depending on what updates are available.
