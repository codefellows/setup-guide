# Ops Setup

## Network Connectivity

First, check that your lab PC is connected to your home network via ethernet or Wi-Fi. Then, use the Ubuntu desktop GUI to update the Ubuntu OS to the latest version.

- On the back of the lab kit PC, on its I/O shield, you'll find the ethernet port. If you need an ethernet cable, check the packaging for your SOHO router and use the included cable. Plug the cable into the back of the PC and run it to your home router/modem.
- Alternatively, try the included wi-fi adapter (antenna with USB).
