# Ops Setup

## Update Linux

- Log in to Ubuntu Linux Desktop and open a Terminal session. Search for "Terminal" in the menu system and be sure to favorite this app.
- Run `sudo apt update` to update your Apt package manager. Always run this command before installing a new software package from Apt.
- Run `sudo apt install xrdp -y`, which installs a software package that will allow you to connect to this lab kit PC remotely in subsequent classes. The `-y` option bypasses an "Are you sure?" prompt.
- Allow the RDP server to initialize on startup with `sudo systemctl enable --now xrdp`. You'll need this in Class 7.
