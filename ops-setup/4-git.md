# Ops Setup

You'll use the `git` command for managing the Ops scripts you write. Let's set it up now.

## Git Installation

1. Run `sudo apt install git -y` in the terminal to install Git.
1. Run `mkdir ~/github` to create a folder to store repositories.
1. Run `cd ~/github` to move there.
   - This is how you can change the "current folder" you are working in, from within the Linux shell.

## Download file to be used later

1. In the terminal, run: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codefellows/setup-guide/main/configs/ops/gnome-terminal-profiles.dconf`
