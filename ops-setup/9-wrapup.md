# Ops Setup

That's about it!

## Wrapup

We've been tracking some of progress along the way. 

Run the following to see a summary of what was installed:

- `cat ~/Downloads/deployerlog.txt`

Take a moment to review what's reported there.

If it sounds about right, you are done! If you aren't sure, reach out to your instructor to get it verified. 

We can't wait to hear from you, and see you in class!
