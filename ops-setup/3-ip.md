# Ops Setup

Keep track of your IP address. 

## Get Your Internet Protocol (IP) Address

1. Review this walkthrough on [how the ip command works](https://itsfoss.com/check-ip-address-ubuntu/){target: "_blank"}
1. Use the `ip a` command in the Terminal to check your IP address.
1. Identify your IPv4 address from the output of the `ip a` command and write it down/take note somewhere.
   - If you wrote down `127.0.0.1` as your IP address, that's not quite right. Re-read the link above and look a little closer.
> If you're really having trouble identifying the IPv4 address from the output of `ip a`, trying running the `hostname -I` command.
