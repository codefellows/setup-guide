# Verify Your Setup

> By the time youâ€™ve completed the guide, you should be able to run the following commands in your terminal and see the expected output.  Your versions may be slightly different than what is listed here due to recent updates.

Run the following set of commands:

```bash
mongod --version
mongo --version
eslint --version
```

You output should resemble the following, with your version numbers likely being different:

```bash
db version v4.4.1
Build Info: {
    "version": "4.4.1",
    "gitVersion": "ad91a93a5a31e175f5cbf8c69561e788bbc55ce1",
    "modules": [],
    "allocator": "system",
    "environment": {
        "distarch": "x86_64",
        "target_arch": "x86_64"
    }
}

MongoDB shell version v4.4.1
Build Info: {
    "version": "4.4.1",
    "gitVersion": "ad91a93a5a31e175f5cbf8c69561e788bbc55ce1",
    "modules": [],
    "allocator": "system",
    "environment": {
        "distarch": "x86_64",
        "target_arch": "x86_64"
    }
}
