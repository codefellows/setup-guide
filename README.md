# Computer Setup Instructions

Whether you are starting class, needing to set up a new system, or re-install proper config on an existing system, these steps will walk you through what is needed.

**This setup should be done in a single session.**  Please allow a minimum of **1** hour to complete.

You do not need to understand what this process is doing. This is a vital step that will allow you to use technologies required throughout the curriculum.

NOTE: You will be asked to download some stuff.  For this setup process please **right-click** on links to **open in a new tab** when asked to download and install.  This is so you don't lose your place.
